# **App Name**: VerdantAI

## Core Features:

- Image Input: Implement an intuitive interface for image upload and capture, allowing users to easily submit plant images for identification and disease detection.
- Plant Identification: Integrate Google Gemini Vision Pro to identify plant species from uploaded images and display the results, including common and scientific names, along with care tips.
- Disease Detection: Integrate Google Gemini Vision Pro to detect plant diseases from uploaded images and provide information on symptoms, causes, treatments, and prevention methods. The LLM may use a tool to decide if the information about the disease should be displayed to the user.
- My Garden: Allow users to save identified plants to a personal garden dashboard, where they can track care information and set reminders for watering and maintenance.
- GreenAI Assistant: Implement an AI-powered chat interface using Google Gemini to provide personalized advice and contextual suggestions for plant care, acting as a helpful assistant. The LLM may use a tool to decide if the information about some specific fertilizer should be displayed to the user.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Natural green (#0E8F6E) for primary buttons, key UI elements, and branding.
- Secondary color: Light sage (#F2FCE2) for backgrounds, cards, and secondary elements.
- Accent color: Warm earth tones (#1A3129) for highlights, special features, and emphasis.
- Headings: Clear, modern sans-serif font (Inter or similar), medium to semi-bold weights.
- Body text: Highly readable sans-serif with appropriate line height and letter spacing.
- Use Lucide React icons consistently throughout the interface.
- Cards: Rounded corners (8px radius), subtle drop shadows, minimal borders.
- Subtle fade transitions between screens (300ms duration, ease timing function).

## Original User Request:
Project Overview
Develop a Progressive Web App (PWA) named "Plant Care System (GreenHealth)" that empowers users to identify plants, detect plant diseases, and manage their garden collections. The application should be visually appealing, user-friendly, and fully functional across devices with offline capabilities.

Loading states with branded animation for AI processing
Responsive Design
Mobile-first approach with optimized layouts for tablets and desktops
Critical breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
Consistent spacing system based on 4px increments
Accessibility
Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for all text
Focus states clearly visible for keyboard navigation
Semantic HTML structure with appropriate ARIA attributes
